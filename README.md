# Intelligent decision-making Chatbot

### 1. Introduction
**Problem Statement**

Artificial intelligence chatbot is a technology that makes interactions between man
and machine using natural language possible. Although chatbot just produced only
one output instead of multiple outputs/results, the basic process flow is the same
where each time an input is entered, the new search will be done. Nothing related
to previous output. Hence, it may lead to a problem in decision making.

**Solution**

The objective is to develop a tree data structure with a chatbot, such that it would 
be able to perform relative decision making based on user inputs, preferences and interactions 
with the chatbot. 
The tree is then traversed with the conditions and preferences given by the user and throws out probable results. 
A mapping algorithm which maps the user inputs into respective nodes of the tree and is updated/traversed at user discretion.
